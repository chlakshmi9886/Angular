1. Open any location on your PC and create a new folder for project

                    E:\TypeScript-App

2. Open project folder in "Visual Studio Code"

3. Open Terminal
        Terminal Menu => New Terminal    or   [Ctrl + `]

4. Switch to Command Prompt [If it is using Power Shell]

                        TypeScript Architecture
                         ---------------------------------
1. Core TypeScript Compiler
    - It is responsible for tracking and reporting errors in program.
    - Syntax errors
    - Parsing errors
    - Input and output errors
   
2. Standalone TS compiler
   - It is responsible for translating TypeScript program into JavaScript
    [tsc.ts]

3. Language Service
  - It comprises of the library required for a language.

4. TsServer
  - It is responsible for hosting, listening, request and response.
  - It loads your typescript program, compiles and handles request and response.

5. VS Shims
  - Shim makes your language platform neutral.
  - Shim is an API
